Linchat 1.0

Linchat is a simple chat program for local Unix users. It has been tested
only under Linux but may work under other Unixlike OSs too.

It only works locally, i.e. ON THE SAME MACHINE. For this reason, it's fairly
secure against external eavesdroppers if the connections to that machine are secure.
However, don't assume that other local users cannot eavesdrop.

This is intended as a useful multi-user (>2) replacement for talk. ytalk supports
more than two users, but becomes useless after about 3 users or so.

Linchat requires no separate server and does not require root access to install.

how to install: put the binary in /usr/local/bin or anywhere else you like really.

How to uninstall: delete it

Stores no config files anywhere. Keeps only temp files in /tmp

---

How it works:

Upon startup, the program creates a directory /tmp/linchatdir if it
does not already exist.

A file called "scoreboard" is created which stores who is logged on at any
given moment. This file is mmaped by each instance of linchat.

Each client creates a unix socket in this directory with its PID.
